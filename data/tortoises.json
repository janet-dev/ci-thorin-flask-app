        "description": "Pearl is not a cuddler. She is more like the quirky, misunderstood heroine of an art-house film with a tough outer shell and a mushy center with a heart of gold. To be specific, she is a spurred African sulcata tortoise we picked up (quite literally) half a world away from her native Saharan motherland â€” in a leafy suburban neighborhood just south of Los Angeles.",

        "name": "Boris the Russian tortoise",
        "description": "Boris is a Russian or Horsfield tortoise and was imported legally as a hatchling from Uzbekistan. The Russian tortoise (Testudo horsfieldii), also commonly known as the Afghan tortoise, the Central Asian tortoise, Horsfield's tortoise, four-clawed tortoise, and the (Russian) steppe tortoise, is a threatened species of tortoise in the family Testudinidae. The species is endemic to Central Asia. Human activities in its native habitat contribute to its threatened status.",

        "name": "Thorin the tortoise. Or turtle?",
        "description": "The American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists uses 'turtle' to describe all species of the order Testudines, regardless of whether they are land-dwelling or sea-dwelling, and uses 'tortoise' as a more specific term for slow-moving terrestrial species. British usage, by contrast, tends not to use 'turtle' as a generic term for all members of the order, and also applies the term 'tortoises' broadly to all land-dwelling members of the order Testudines, regardless of whether they are actually members of the family Testudinidae. In Britain, terrapin is used to refer to a larger group of semiaquatic turtles than the restricted meaning in America.",
