    <p>
        Pet store sales of sulcatas are controversial because the tortoises are about the size of a silver dollar when
        they are young and shoppers may not be aware of what they are signing up for — resulting in poor care,
        mistreatment or abandonment. (In fact, the American Tortoise Rescue is calling for a moratorium on Sulcata sales
        because full-grown, unwanted tortoises are swamping rescues and zoos cannot take them all.)

            <h3>Pearl the African tortoise</h3>
            <p>
                Pearl is not a cuddler. She is more like the quirky, misunderstood heroine of an art-house film with a
                tough outer shell and a mushy center with a heart of gold. To be specific, she is a spurred African
                sulcata tortoise we picked up (quite literally) half a world away from her native Saharan motherland —
                in a leafy suburban neighborhood just south of Los Angeles.

            <p>
                The Russian tortoise (Testudo horsfieldii), also commonly known as the Afghan tortoise, the Central
                Asian tortoise, Horsfield's tortoise, four-clawed tortoise, and the (Russian) steppe tortoise, is
                a threatened species of tortoise in the family Testudinidae. The species is endemic to Central Asia.
                Human activities in its native habitat contribute to its threatened status.
