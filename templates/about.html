        Pet store sales of sulcatas are controversial because the tortoises are about the size of a silver dollar when
        they are young and shoppers may not be aware of what they are signing up for â€” resulting in poor care,
        mistreatment or abandonment. In fact, the American Tortoise Rescue is calling for a moratorium on Sulcata sales
        because full-grown, unwanted tortoises are swamping rescues and zoos cannot take them all.
